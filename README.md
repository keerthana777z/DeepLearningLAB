# 🎓 Deep Learning Lab Assignments – AR Keerthana

This repository contains the official lab assignments completed as part of the **Deep Learning Laboratory** course during my academic curriculum.

Each experiment demonstrates the practical implementation of core deep learning concepts such as artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), transfer learning, and regression using modern frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
